# Next.js + Rainbow Kit Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Rainbow Kit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) starter.

## Requirements

- Node 10+
- Yarn (or NPM if you prefer)
- You will need an Alchemy account to access the Alchemy API. If you don't have one yet, sign up [here](https://www.alchemy.com/).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository you can run `yarn` to install the dependencies. 

Then, create `.env` file
```
touch .env
```
Inside `.env`, set this variable:
```
ALCHEMY_ID=your_alchemy_application_id
```
Then start the application with `yarn dev`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jeanniesarah/nextjs-rainbowkit-starter.git
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

You are now able to view the application at http://localhost:3000 ðŸŽ‰

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
